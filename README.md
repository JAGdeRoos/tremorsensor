# Tremor Sensor Inator

This repo contains the Arduino (cpp) code from my [Instructable](https://www.instructables.com/Build-Your-Own-Tremor-Sensor-inator/)

For this project, I developed a tremor sensor for Parkinsonâ€™s patients.

A project I made as a final year BA student at the HAN University of Applied Sciences studying Embedded Systems Engineering (ESE).
